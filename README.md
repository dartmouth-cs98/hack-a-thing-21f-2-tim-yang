# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I have further improved on my 2D text game last time, as this is relavant for my project idea, which is to build a 2D text-based adventure/survival game with the theme of leading hunter-gatherer tribes.

As shown in the screenshots, the game is on-going with the character able to move around the dungeon pressing buttons and engage with the rooms they encountered. The character may attack or flee when encountering an enemy, and open chests when explored a room with a chest. The energy and money stats are constantly changing base on the actions you take, whether you gain money from opening chests or killing enemies, and/or suffer damage from engaging in combats with enemies. Furthermore, the central textbox shows the players' past actions and current happenings, allowing for a full-on story-based adventure game. One can scroll back the text box in order to see what has happened in the past.


## Who Did What?

I worked on this alone.


## What you learned

I've made everything work since last time and I was glad to see the combat stats/money change dynamically. I've learned a lot from learning from this tutorial, including using multiple objects/classes in order to build multiple game systems, singleton programming, creating a 2D UI game, and much more. I'm more confident now that the game I've been thinking to create could become a reality.
