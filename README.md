# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I have further improved on my 2D text game last time, as this is relavant for my project idea, which is to build a 2D text-based adventure/survival game with the theme of leading hunter-gatherer tribes.

As shown in the screenshots, the game is on-going with the character able to move around the dungeon pressing buttons and engage with the rooms they encountered. The character may attack or flee when encountering an enemy, and open chests when explored a room with a chest. The energy and money stats are constantly changing base on the actions you take, whether you gain money from opening chests or killing enemies, and/or suffer damage from engaging in combats with enemies. Furthermore, the central textbox shows the players' past actions and current happenings, allowing for a full-on story-based adventure game. One can scroll back the text box in order to see what has happened in the past.


## Who Did What?

I worked on this alone.


## What you learned

I've made everything work since last time and I was glad to see the combat stats/money change dynamically. I've learned a lot from learning from this tutorial, including using multiple objects/classes in order to build multiple game systems, singleton programming, creating a 2D UI game, and much more. I'm more confident now that the game I've been thinking to create could become a reality.

## How I've been inspired

I've been inspired to make a 2D text-based game that will include many game systems inspired from learning this tutorial. In the Hunter-Gatherer game I've been thinking, the "enemies" will be replaced by animals that the tribe could hunt together, the "player" would be replaced by a tribe that the player leads, which itself will be composed of many tribe members that are similar to "items" that could be collected (although each member would be a lot more complicated with different stats/perks/abilities and all that), the "map system" would be replaced by a geographical location to which the tribe would be able to explore and utilize resources from, on top of meeting other tribes and making diplomatic relationships with. The buttons of actions would be replaced by time-related actions, so that each action taken signals time pass/turn, and each turn the stats of the tribe would be affected based on the current modifiers and everything. This game tutorial has definitely allowed me to be more ambotious and creative with the game I would like to create in order to influence positive change. Thank you.
